# üî• About me
- Hi! This is Xinyan, an undergraduate student from Wuhan University. I'm currently studying in both Biology and Computer. I'm pretty interest in Neuroscience and looking forwark to a PhD study in the future soon. Through the passing acadamic years I've gained a skill set for it, including experimental skills from molecular and cellular biology to animal(mice) experiment. I'm especially familiar with electrophyisiology, including on single cell, brain slice and animal. I also got great experience in data analysis and programming.
- During my experience as research assistant, I found out that I really enjoy communicate with people from different background and learnt a lot from them, which gives me confidence to work out any problem that I face.
- Thank you for reading this and hope we could find good cooperation!

  
# üìñ Education

# üíª Research Experience
- *2023.10 - 2024.4*, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, USA | Helen Hou Lab
Researched neural control of facial movements in rodents. Studied the direct regulation of facial movements in mice by the facial nucleus (FN). Set up an experimental platform combining in vivo electrophysiology and high-speed camera recordings. Built platform hardware, control programs, and processed electrophysiology data. Conducted behavioral training and in vivo electrophysiology recordings on mice.

- *2023.7 - 2023.9*, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore | Alfred Sun Lab
Investigated iPSC-induced differentiation of neurons. Studied the effects of different culture conditions and nutritional statuses on the maturity of induced differentiated neurons using single-cell electrophysiology recordings. Independently performed recordings and relevant data processing (Matlab).
