# üî• About me
- Hi! This is Xinyan, an undergraduate student from Wuhan University. I'm pretty interest in Neuroscience and looking forward to a PhD study in the future soon. During my experience as research assistant, I found out that I really enjoy communicate with people from different background and learnt a lot from them, which gives me confidence to work out any problem that I face.
- Thank you for reading this and hope we could find good cooperation!

# üìñ Education
- *2020.9 - 2025.6 (expected)*, Wuhan University <br>
Bachelor of Science in in Biology Science <br>
Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology
- GPA: 3.76/4.0

# üíª Research Experience
- *2023.10 - 2024.4*, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, USA | Helen Hou Lab <br>
Researched neural control of facial movements in rodents. Studied the direct regulation of facial movements in mice by the facial nucleus (FN). Set up an experimental platform combining in vivo electrophysiology and high-speed camera recordings. Built platform hardware, control programs, and processed electrophysiology data. Conducted behavioral training and in vivo electrophysiology recordings on mice.

- *2023.7 - 2023.9*, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore | Alfred Sun Lab <br>
Investigated iPSC-induced differentiation of neurons. Studied the effects of different culture conditions and nutritional statuses on the maturity of induced differentiated neurons using single-cell electrophysiology recordings. Independently performed recordings and relevant data processing (Matlab).

- *2021.7 - 2023.6*, School of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, China | Jing Yao Lab <br>
Learned and participated in research about drug interaction on TRPV channels. Learned cell culture, molecular cloning, patch clamp, usage and data processing of related software. <br>
Learned and participated in research about glutamate release in hippocampus. Learned animal training,  immunohistochemistry, and data processing.

# üìù Project Experience 
- *2021.12 - 2022.10*, International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) | Leader <br>
Led team members in project establishment and experiments. Conceptualized and refined the project design on probiotics improving depression symptoms. Created a full wiki webpage, and presented at the international competition.<br>
(check it at https://2022.igem.wiki/whu-china/ !)
- *2021.8*, University of Cambridge, UK | Computational Neuroscience Course <br>
Collaborated with group members to complete Python code for simulating neuronal network firing balance, created and presented to Cambridge University course professors. Received a completion certificate.
